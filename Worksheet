## Review
1. What is your favorite CS topic you've learned so far?
In COMP181, I already had experience with java coming in so the most valuable skill that I learned was test-driven development. 
This really helped me to not have complex bugs later on in the coding process. 

## Exploration
2. What is the most difficult CS topic you've learned so far?
Recursion. I know the basics but it is still difficult. That is what this class is for. 

## Challenge
3. What do you most look forward to learning this semester?
Binary search. This is s basic search algorithm that a lot of other things are built on. Good to have a really solid understanding of the basics.
